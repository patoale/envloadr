## ðŸ’¬ Discussions for Non-Issue Topics

While we use **Issues** to track bugs, tasks, and specific feature requests, **Discussions** provides a space for more open-ended conversations that **don't require immediate action**. You can use Discussions for:

- ðŸ¤” **Asking questions** about how to use the project, or to clarify parts of the documentation.
- ðŸ’¡ **Sharing ideas** for new features, improvements, or how the project could evolve.
- ðŸ‘¥ **Engaging with the community** in casual conversations, or discussing the vision of the project.
- ðŸ“š **Providing educational resources**, tutorials, or links that could benefit other contributors.

By keeping these types of conversations in Discussions, we can maintain Issues focused on real problems and development tasks.
