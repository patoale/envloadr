## 💬 Discussions for Non-Issue Topics

While we use **Issues** to track bugs, tasks, and specific feature requests, **Discussions** provides a space for more open-ended conversations that **don't require immediate action**. You can use Discussions for:

- 🤔 **Asking questions** about how to use the project, or to clarify parts of the documentation.
- 💡 **Sharing ideas** for new features, improvements, or how the project could evolve.
- 👥 **Engaging with the community** in casual conversations, or discussing the vision of the project.
- 📚 **Providing educational resources**, tutorials, or links that could benefit other contributors.

By keeping these types of conversations in Discussions, we can maintain Issues focused on real problems and development tasks.

## 📝 Issues and Feature Requests

If you’ve found a **task that requires immediate attention** or action, like a **bug** or a **specific feature request**, please follow the steps below.

### Search First

Before opening a new issue, **check the existing [issues](https://github.com/patoale/envloadr/issues)** to see if the same topic has already been reported.  
If you find something similar, consider commenting or adding a reaction instead of creating a duplicate.

### Guidelines for Creating Issues

- **Use a descriptive title** that summarizes the issue clearly.
- **Explain the context**: what you were doing, what you expected, and what actually happened.
- **Provide reproduction steps** or logs if helpful.
- **Tag appropriately** (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`) if you have permissions.
